Automator Workflows
===================

A collection of Automator workflows that I find useful. They are mostly aimed at making me more productive

## List of Actions
* `Add Emails to Toodledo.workflow`:<br/>sends selected emails to Toodledo (making them "todo" items) and files them in Mail
* `Evernote Checkboxes to Toodledo.workflow`: scans specifically-tagged Evernote notes for unchecked checkboxes and, upon finding them, sends them as todos to Evernote

## Installation

Unless otherwise noted, installation of these workflows is simple: merely download them to your filesystem and double-click. That's it.
